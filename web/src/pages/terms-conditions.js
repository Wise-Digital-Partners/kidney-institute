                ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THE FIRM, WHETHER
                BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION OR
                ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND
                BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A
                COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.  YOU AND THE FIRM HEREBY WAIVE THE

                EXPRESSLY AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A
                CLASS ACTION. The arbitration will be administered by the

                hearing will be held in San Francisco County, California. The

                with respect to arbitrability issues, federal arbitration law
                will govern). The arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of
                this Agreement and will be final and binding. The arbitrator

                injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance
                of this Agreement, but only to the extent necessary to provide
                relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator.
                The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and
                enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  This clause
                shall not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies
                in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

                court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid,
                that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum
